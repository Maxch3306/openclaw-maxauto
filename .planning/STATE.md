## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Skills before Workspace before Telegram (research-informed ordering)
- Roadmap: Phase 1 (config.patch) is prerequisite for all feature phases to prevent write races
- Roadmap: Phase 9 (binding) depends on both per-agent workspace and Telegram access control

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tauri dialog plugin availability needs verification for workspace folder picker (Phase 5)
- config.patch auto-restart behavior on Windows -- SIGUSR1 is Unix-only, may need fallback (Phase 1)
